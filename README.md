I am in my junior year pursuing a bachelor of engineering in Computer Science at BITS Goa, India. I like to develop web apps and learn about new technologies while building projects using them. I also contribute to open source organizations especially the techonologies I use myself. I enjoy competitive programming and take part in competitions regularly.
